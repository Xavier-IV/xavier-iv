### ⚡ Fun fact

My first memorable program, is a Rails chat system that I develop. The fun part is, my friend can communicate with me in his own laptop's browser!

Despite its a simple port forwarding IP, the fact that I can see his chat when I refresh my page, is awesome.

Been loving developing ever since.
