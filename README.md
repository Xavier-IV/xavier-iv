### 👋 About Me

A software engineer working on NodeJS, a 🇲🇾 Malaysian who's currently in 🇩🇪 Germany.

You can check out [my landing page](https://zafranudin.dev/).

Since I'm working on heavy NodeJS projects, I'm excited to work on Flutter to diversify my knowledge.

### ⚡ Fun fact

My first memorable program, is a Rails chat system that I develop. The fun part is, my friend can communicate with me in his own laptop's browser!

Despite its a simple port forwarding IP, the fact that I can see his chat when I refresh my page, is awesome.

Been loving developing ever since.


### 🍳 What's cooking?

Delving into Rails for some side project ideas I've been having lately!
